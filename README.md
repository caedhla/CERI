##What is our project

We are working to develop social and environmental indicators of community resilience to disasters. We are hoping to use this training to help us build an index of weighted indicators. We are interested in using R to be able to integrate different types of data e.g. numeric, binary, qualitative text, Likert scale, etc., to build an index.
